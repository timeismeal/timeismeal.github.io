Armed with a vision and a thirst for innovation, I dived deep into the world of technology, exploring new avenues and tools to bring the best to the table. Here&apos;s a snapshot of the action-packed week:</p><h3 id="choosing-the-right-back-end-firebase-vs-supabase"><strong><strong>Choosing the Right Back-end: Firebase vs. Supabase</strong></strong></h3><p>The week started with me weighing the pros and cons of Firebase against Supabase. While Firebase offers a good range of services, my history with its authentication service has been a mixed bag. Moreover, with my strong familiarity with PostgreSQL, Supabase emerged as the clear winner. The platform&apos;s Row-Level Security policies and the ability to reflect real-time database changes on the web app were the cherries on top.</p><h3 id="ui-makeover-bootstrapping-with-tailwind"><strong><strong>UI Makeover: Bootstrapping with Tailwind</strong></strong></h3><p>After over a decade of loyalty to Bootstrap, it was time to flirt with something new: Tailwind. Partnering it with DaisyUI proved to be a match made in heaven. While Tailwind offered lightness and customizability, DaisyUI brought in the much-needed components. And guess who played matchmaker? My AI co-pilot, which not only suggested DaisyUI but also assisted me in mastering Tailwind best practices.</p><h3 id="database-shenanigans-with-supabase"><strong><strong>Database Shenanigans with Supabase</strong></strong></h3><p>The AI continued to be my trusted ally, as I ventured into implementing the database in Supabase. From double-checking SQL codes to crafting functions and triggers, the AI was instrumental. For instance, when a new user is created in Supabase Authentication, a corresponding profile gets auto-created in my database, thanks to a nifty trigger the AI helped write SQL statements and proofread them.</p><h3 id="filling-the-pantry"><strong><strong>Filling the Pantry</strong></strong></h3><p>To ensure the web app had a rich database to work with, I enlisted the AI&apos;s expertise once again. It helped populate categories with a variety of foods and products, making sure users had a plethora to explore.</p><h3 id="a-milestone-moment-breathing-life-into-time-is-meal"><strong><strong>A Milestone Moment: Breathing Life into Time is Meal</strong></strong></h3><p>The week&apos;s highlight was undoubtedly the successful integration of OpenAI&apos;s chat module. This was not just another feature addition; it was the realization of Time is Meal&apos;s core vision: to be AI-powered. The proof-of-concept marked a pivotal moment. It signifies that Time is Meal isn&apos;t just another app; it&apos;s the beginning of an AI-driven revolution in meal planning and grocery shopping. With this foundation laid, the sky&apos;s the limit. We&apos;re not stopping here; this is just the launchpad for the exciting innovations to come.</p><h3 id="giving-birth-to-your-ai-culinary-companion"><strong>Giving Birth to Your AI Culinary Companion</strong></h3><p>Every great kitchen has a master chef, and for Time is Meal, we envisioned a digital chef &#x2014; an AI entity that would assist users throughout their journey in the web app. This isn&apos;t just any ordinary chef; it&apos;s a blend of technology, creativity, and culinary expertise. The AI played a pivotal role in bringing this vision closer to reality in two significant ways:</p><ol><li><strong>Naming the Chef</strong>: A name isn&apos;t just a label; it&apos;s an identity. With the AI&apos;s insights, we&apos;ve chosen a name that encapsulates the essence of our digital chef. A name that resonates with culinary expertise and technological innovation.</li><li><strong>Crafting the Image</strong>: Beyond the name, we wanted our chef to have a face &#x2014; an avatar that users could connect with. Using generative image AI, we&apos;ve crafted an avatar that&apos;s both engaging and representative of our vision.</li></ol><p>While we&apos;re bursting with excitement, we&apos;re holding onto the big reveal for now. Both the name and the avatar will be unveiled soon. So, keep those taste buds (and your curiosity) tingling!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518770660439-4636190af475?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEwM3x8a2l0Y2hlbiUyMHRlY2hub2xvZ3l8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjk3NDc2MTc5fDA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="A Week of Innovations: Charting New Waters" loading="lazy" width="5530" height="3687" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518770660439-4636190af475?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEwM3x8a2l0Y2hlbiUyMHRlY2hub2xvZ3l8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjk3NDc2MTc5fDA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518770660439-4636190af475?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEwM3x8a2l0Y2hlbiUyMHRlY2hub2xvZ3l8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjk3NDc2MTc5fDA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518770660439-4636190af475?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEwM3x8a2l0Y2hlbiUyMHRlY2hub2xvZ3l8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjk3NDc2MTc5fDA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518770660439-4636190af475?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEwM3x8a2l0Y2hlbiUyMHRlY2hub2xvZ3l8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjk3NDc2MTc5fDA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alexkixa?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Alexandre Debi&#xE8;ve</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3><p>In essence, last week was a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and the sheer potential that AI brings to the table.

For me, it amplified a pain point that had been simmering for a while: grocery shopping.</p><h3 id="checkout-in-a-name-unpacking-the-brand">Checkout in a Name? Unpacking the Brand</h3><p>There&apos;s a popular saying, &quot;time is money,&quot; highlighting how precious our time is. In the same vein, I realized that every minute I spent stressing over groceries and meal planning was a minute I could have spent on something valuable. Thus, the idea of &quot;Time is Meal&quot; was born. Time, like a well-cooked meal, is precious and should be savored, not wasted on tedious tasks.</p><h3 id="the-pandemics-grocery-challenge">The Pandemic&apos;s Grocery Challenge</h3><p>Before the pandemic, forgetting an ingredient from the grocery list was a painful inconvenience. But during the pandemic, it became a significant stressor. Every trip to the store mattered. Every item on the list was crucial. Yet, week after week, I found myself overlooking essential ingredients. Sometimes, the forgotten items were just minor additions. Other times, they were the heart of the meal. Going back to the store, especially in those times, was the last thing I wanted.</p><h3 id="family-favorites-and-indecisiveness">Family Favorites and Indecisiveness</h3><p>Meal planning had always been a hot topic in my household. With diverse tastes and preferences, reaching a consensus was an Olympic sport. Sure, there are numerous meal planning apps out there. But most of them offered new recipes or comprehensive meal plans. That wasn&apos;t what I needed. I had a repertoire of family favorites, dishes my kids loved, and tried-and-true recipes that had been passed down through generations. I wasn&apos;t looking for new recipes; I wanted a way to quickly select our beloved meals, generate a grocery list, and ensure I never forgot an ingredient in one single trip.</p><h3 id="the-birth-of-time-is-meal">The Birth of Time is Meal</h3><p>With this need in mind, I set out one weekend to craft a solution. The result? The first version of Time is Meal. It was basic, a little rough around the edges, but it did exactly what I needed. For three years, I used this home-baked app. It saved me countless hours, reduced the number of trips to the grocery store, and, best of all, diminished the family quarrels over meal choices.</p><h3 id="ai-powered-evolution">AI-Powered Evolution</h3><p>Though the original Time is Meal has served me well, the world of tech never stands still. And neither do I. As I embark on crafting version 2.0, I&apos;m integrating the power of artificial intelligence to make it even smarter, more intuitive, and tailored to serve a wider audience. &quot;<em>One list. One trip. Every ingredient</em>.&quot; remains the core mantra, but with AI&apos;s touch, it&apos;s shaping up to be more insightful and user-centric than ever.</p><h3 id="journeying-together">Journeying Together</h3><p>But here&apos;s the best part: I&apos;m not on this journey alone. I&apos;m bringing all of you along with me. Through this blog, you&apos;ll be by my side as I navigate the challenges, celebrate the milestones, and refine this tool. We&apos;ll explore the fascinating world of AI, uncover its potential in enhancing everyday tasks, and together, we&apos;ll witness the evolution of Time is Meal from a personal solution to a global asset.</p><h3 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h3><p>From a simple weekend project to an AI-enhanced revolution, Time is Meal stands as a testament to what personal determination and technology can achieve. As we move forward, I&apos;m thrilled to share every step of this evolution with you. Let&apos;s make meal planning and grocery shopping not just efficient, but also enjoyable!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Embarking on a grocery journey: The birth of 'Time is Meal' and the role of AI]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&apos;m introducing you to a project that&apos;s been brewing in my mind for quite some time: <strong>Time is Meal</strong>.</p><p>Like many of you, I&apos;ve faced the weekly conundrum of meal planning.

The long hours spent deciding on meals, the tedious task of jotting down every ingredient, and that sinking feeling when you realize you forgot the most crucial item (like butter, perhaps?) halfway through cooking. This repetitive cycle not only disrupts our culinary adventures but often strains our relationships with loved ones over something as simple as a grocery list.</p><p>Enter <strong>Time is Meal</strong> - an app designed to transform your grocery shopping experience. But this isn&apos;t just another meal planning app. This is a blend of personal pain points, cutting-edge AI technology, and a vision to make every mealtime a joyous occasion.</p><h3 id="why-ai">Why AI?</h3><p>You might wonder, &quot;Why bring AI into meal planning?&quot; Well, the potential of AI to understand nuanced personal preferences, dietary restrictions, and to predict and plan based on patterns is immense. I envision a tool where AI doesn&apos;t just suggest meals but understands you. Where it doesn&apos;t just create a grocery list but ensures it&apos;s exhaustive, down to the last sprinkle of salt.</p><h3 id="ai-as-my-co-pilot">AI as My Co-Pilot</h3><p>As I delve into the development of <strong>Time is Meal</strong>, AI will be my trusty sidekick. From assisting in writing and infusing creativity into the app&apos;s design to helping troubleshoot coding challenges, AI will play a pivotal role. I aim to document this dual journey: building an app with AI and building an AI-powered app.</p><h3 id="a-promise-to-you">A Promise to You</h3><p>Through this blog, I&apos;ll chronicle the highs, the lows, the challenges, and the breakthroughs. You&apos;ll get a front-row seat to the evolution of <strong>Time is Meal</strong> and the transformative power of AI. And I hope, in sharing this journey, we can start a conversation about technology, food, and the intersections of the two in our daily lives.</p><p>So, as I embark on this exciting expedition, I invite you to join me.
